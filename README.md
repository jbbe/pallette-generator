## Pallette Generator 
This is a simple tool to build color palettes. Palettes can either be generated from a dropped image or built from scratch. Some color relationships for colors have been implemented. Pallettes can be saved either as a png with the colors in squares over a white background or as a text file of hex codes. 

I wrote this mostly to simplify the process of modifying and collecting palettes for pixel art. The ui uses the egui framework.
